# SCJS Feb 2017: VoiceVote App

This is part of the VoiceVote app which includes:

1. [IoT repo](https://github.com/jeffreypriebe/scjs-17-02-IoT-VoiceVote-IoT) (to be run on the Edison)
2. [Server](https://github.com/jeffreypriebe/scjs-17-02-IoT-VoiceVote-Server-App/tree/master/ServerVoiceVote) & [Mobile App](https://github.com/jeffreypriebe/scjs-17-02-IoT-VoiceVote-Server-App/tree/master/AppVoiceVote) repo (to be run on server, mobile app respectively)

This is the combined Server & Mobile App repo.
Normally this would be two separate repos, but they are combined for the purposes of this setup since the focus is the Edison/IoT code.
